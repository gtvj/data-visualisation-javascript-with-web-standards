# Full stack web development with Flask

This is the companion app I've created for this course on O'Reilly. 

## Development machine configuration

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 and pip installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
4. From the root directory run `source venv/bin/activate` 
5. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start the application with `flask run`
7. See the command line for the URL to visit
8. When finished run `deactivate` from the virtual environment
